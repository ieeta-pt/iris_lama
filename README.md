LaMa - A Localization and Mapping library.
==========================================

LaMa is a C++11 software library for robotic localization and mapping developed at the **Intelligent Robotics and Systems** (IRIS) Laboratory from the University of Aveiro - Portugal. It includes a framework for 3D volumetric grids (for mapping), a localization algorithm based on scan matching and two SLAM solution (an *Online SLAM* and a *Particle Filter SLAM*).

The main feature is *efficiency*. Low computational effort and low memory usage whenever possible. The minimum viable computer to run our localization and SLAM solutions is a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).
